# Amazon ECS now provides real-time deployment observability in the AWS Management Console

## 내용

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) now provides real-time service deployment observability in the Amazon ECS Console for native Linear, Canary, and Blue/Green deployment strategies. With this launch, deployment monitoring and troubleshooting come together in one place in the console, so you can track deployment progress, monitor health, and diagnose failures without switching between tools.
Real-time service deployment observability includes a live deployment timeline that narrates each service deployment as it happens, showing every deployment phase, service events, and task launch and termination progress, always reflecting the current state. As a deployment moves forward, you can follow the traffic shift distribution across your source and target revisions and see the current lifecycle stage at a glance, whether it is scaling up green tasks, waiting on a lifecycle hook, or sitting through bake time. Deployment health signals that you would otherwise gather from separate tools now sit alongside the timeline: circuit breaker status with live task failure and threshold tracking, deployment alarm state, container and load-balancer health checks, and lifecycle hook status. When something goes wrong, failed tasks surface right in the timeline with diagnostic context and deep links to services such as AWS CloudTrail, so you can pinpoint the root cause and act on it quickly.
 
 
 These capabilities are available at no additional charge in all AWS commercial Regions, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions for all Amazon ECS services using the Amazon ECS native Linear, Canary, and Blue/Green deployment types. To get started, navigate to any Amazon ECS service in the Amazon ECS Console and select the Deployments tab.
